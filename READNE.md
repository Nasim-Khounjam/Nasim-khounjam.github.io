# Nasim Khounjam's Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects Iâ€™ve worked on. I am passionate about solving real-world problems through data and aim to improve my skills in data science continually.

## About Me
I am a data analyst with experience in market research and a strong background in data analysis. I have worked with a variety of data analysis tools and techniques to help businesses make informed decisions. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI to excel in the field of data analytics.

## Projects Overview

1. **EDA of Global Superstore Dataset**: In this project, I conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on the Global Superstore dataset. The goal is to uncover trends in sales, profits, and customer demographics using Python libraries like Pandas and Seaborn. This project highlights how businesses can leverage data insights for decision-making.

2. **COVID-19 Data Visualization**: This project focuses on visualizing the spread and impact of COVID-19 across different countries. Using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, I create interactive visualizations to track trends such as infection rates and mortality over time.

3. **Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning**: In this project, I build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Scikit-learn, with the goal of helping the company identify at-risk customers.
